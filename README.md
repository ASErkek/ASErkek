### Hi there, I'm Abdul Samet Erkek 👋

I'm a Robotics Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience in developing and deploying robust solutions for complex, real-world robotic systems. I specialize in motion planning, inverse kinematics, and control systems for everything from high-dexterity robotic hands to mission-critical avionic units.

My passion lies in bridging the gap between theoretical algorithms and practical, impactful applications in dynamic environments.
